        <h2>Proper Carburettor Tuning for Old CI Model Royal Enfield Bullets</h2>
        <p>In this blog, we'll be discussing the proper and accurate carburettor tuning for old CI model Royal Enfield Bullets. This process, shared by my brother, is often underrated but essential for optimal performance. Whether you have a 350cc or 500cc Bullet, the tuning process remains the same. Typically, a VM 24 carburettor is used for the 350cc model, while a VM 28 carburettor is used for the 500cc model.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the Carburettor Screws</h3>
        <p>Before diving into the tuning process, it's essential to understand the three main screws involved in carburettor tuning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Air Mixture Screw</strong>: Adjusts the air-fuel mixture. Turning it clockwise makes the mixture richer; counterclockwise makes it leaner.</li>
            <li><strong>Idle RPM Screw</strong>: Adjusts the engine's idle speed. Turning it clockwise increases the RPM; counterclockwise decreases it.</li>
            <li><strong>Auxiliary Screw</strong>: Helps pass additional air to the engine. It’s commonly found on models manufactured after 1985.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clarifying the Auxiliary Screw</h3>
        <p>This screw connects to the air filter and engine inlet, allowing additional air to enter. Many CI Bullets before 1985 lack this feature, so if you are tuning such a model, follow the guide up to the air mixture screw phase.</p>

        <h3>Main Tuning Process</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Warm Up the Engine</strong>: Let the bike idle for a few minutes to reach optimal temperature.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust the Auxiliary Screw</strong>: Fully tighten the auxiliary screw by turning it clockwise.</li>
            <li><strong>Increase Idle RPM</strong>: Turn the idle RPM screw clockwise to increase RPM to 2000-2500.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust the Air Mixture Screw</strong>: Close it fully, then turn it counterclockwise. Peak RPM should be around 1.5 to 2 turns.</li>
            <li><strong>Fine-Tune the Auxiliary Screw</strong>: Shift to second gear, open the auxiliary screw clockwise until peak RPM. Shift back to neutral.</li>
            <li><strong>Set Final RPM</strong>: Turn the idle RPM screw counterclockwise to set RPM between 700-1000.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Final Adjustments and Tips</h3>
        <p>If the tuning isn’t stable, repeat the process. If the issue persists, turn off the auxiliary screw and complete the tuning with the air mixture and RPM screws.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean the air filter before starting.</li>
            <li>Clean the spark plug and check the gap.</li>
            <li>If possible, set the spark plug timing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This tuning process is straightforward but requires patience and attention to detail. Take your time and perform each step carefully for the best results.</p>
